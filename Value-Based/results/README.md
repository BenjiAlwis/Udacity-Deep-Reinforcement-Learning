# Deep Q Learning (DQN): Navigation

### Introduction

In this repository you will find the implementation of the Navigation Navigation Project. It is the first project for the Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)

### Project Summary 

In this project, we train an agent to navigate aand collect yellow bananas in a large, square world. it contains both yellow and blue banana as shown below.

### Rewards:
The agent is given a reward of +1 for collecting a yellow banana and a reward of -1 for collecting a blue banana.  The goal is to maximise the cumulative score. This can be achieved by collecting as many yellow bananas as possible while minimising the number of blue bananas. The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### State Space 
Has 37 dimensions and the contains the agents velocity, along with ray-based precpetion of objects around the agents foward direction.

### Actions 
the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four alternative discrete actions corresponding to:

- 0 - move forward.
- 1 - move backward.
- 2 - turn left.
- 3 - turn right.



### Getting Started

#### Step 1: Clone the DRLND Repository
1. Configure your Python environment by following [instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies). These instructions can be found in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Readme.md)
1. By following the instructions you will have PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkits, and all the Python packages required to complete the project.
1. (For Windows users) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. It has not been test on older version but it may work.

#### Step 2: Download the Unity Environment 
1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in this folder, unzip (or decompress) the file and then write the correct path in the argument for creating the environment under the notebook `Navigation_solution.ipynb`:

```python
env = env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana.app")

```
#### Step 3: Explore the Environment
After you have followed the instructions above, open Navigation.ipynb (located in the p1_navigation/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.
    
#### (Optional) Build your Own Environment
For this project, we have built the Unity environment for you, and you must use the environment files that we have provided.

If you are interested in learning to build your own Unity environments after completing the project, you are encouraged to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started-with-Balance-Ball.md), which walk you through all of the details of building an environment from a Unity scene.

### Train a agent
There are 2 options for training the Agent:
1. Execute the provided notebook within this Nanodegree Udacity Online Workspace for "project #1  Navigation".
1. Or build your own local environment and make necessary adjustements for the path to the UnityEnvironment in the code.

Note: that the Workspace does not allow you to see the simulator of the environment; so, if you want to watch the agent while it is t
