# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

In this project, a double-jointed arm was trained to move to target locations within the[Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space is represented using 33 variables. They correspond to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is represented using a vector with four numbers. They correspond to torque applicable to two joints. Each element in the action vector is a number that varies between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic, and n order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started 


### Distributed Training

For this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

The second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  



### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**
	The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  your agent must get an 		average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.


        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    - **_Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents_**
	The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, 		to take into account the presence of many agents.  In particular, your agents must 		get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). 

	- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without 		discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) 		scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
	- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 		agents).

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

 
2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### (Optional) Challenge: Crawler Environment

After you have successfully completed the project, you might like to solve the more difficult **Crawler** environment.

![Crawler][image2]

In this continuous control environment, the goal is to teach a creature with four legs to walk forward without falling.  

You can read more about this environment in the ML-Agents GitHub [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#crawler).  To solve this harder task, you'll need to download a new Unity environment.  (**Note**: Udacity students should not submit a project with this new environment.)

You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Crawler/Crawler_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Crawler/Crawler.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Crawler/Crawler_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Crawler/Crawler_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.  Next, open `Crawler.ipynb` and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Crawler/Crawler_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)
